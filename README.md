# hello-world
The first Github repository

Very interesting, the purpose of using Github for me is just attempting to learn stuffs, nothing like those experienced developers and programmers.
However, the mode of repostory appeals me a lot, so that I may put some of my embedding projects here to get some suggestions.
Sincerely hope that I can meet and get useful suggestions and learn more.
